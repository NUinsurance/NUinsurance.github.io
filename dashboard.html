      <div class="panel-body">Premium is the amount of money you have to pay for insurance. Premiums are usually paid in monthly or quarterly installments. Choosing a medical plan that fits your needs and budget is based mostly on balance between deductible, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket limit.</div>

 <div class="panel-body">International students on an F1 visa do not have any government related health insurance requirements to meet when studying in the USA.

      <div class="panel-body">No prior authorization will be required if services are performed at a participating network ambulatory surgery center (ASC). While the policy encourages services to be performed in the ASC setting, it does not prohibit performance of procedures in the hospital outpatient setting. Coverage determinations will consider the availability of a participating network facility, specialty requirements, physician privileges and whether a patient has an individual need for access to more intensive services. </div>

    <div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body">A single-payer system is one in which health-care providers are paid for their services by the government rather than by private insurers. Every year since 2003, Democrats in Congress have introduced H.R.676, the Expanded & Improved Medicare For All Act. The key provisions are that it would prohibit private health insurers from selling health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under the legislation and that it would raise taxes, including payroll taxes, to pay for the extended coverage</div>

    <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">

They already get government-provided care, but they would have to pay more of their wages to the federal government to finance Mr. Sanders’s new single-payer system.</div>
